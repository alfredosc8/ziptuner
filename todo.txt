TODO:

Save previous search url and add a "Resume Last Search" button on main list.

Search by station name.

Add main menu options to fetch the lists of tags, states, countries...

Handle non-mp3 formats.  Either make note of it on gui or add alt players.

Maybe multiselect stations instead of single select.

Stay on station select screen if you hit play.

Let play be the default instead of save?

Come up with a scheme to stop playing?  Send a bogus filename to player?
