Although it's original purpose was only as a playlist fetcher, it turns out the functionality required to allow you to try a station before saving it's URL also makes the ziptuner itself a functional minimal internet radio player.  You can do this on the command line by designating a program (such as mplayer) to use as a stream player, and also specifying how to stop that player.  See the example script in the sources for more details.
